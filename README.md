# MoviesHavasu

This was my first CRUD app that attempted to solve a problem using mongodb, express, and node. The problem was how this particular movie theater's website is subpar and I was going to try to fix it. EJS was used for the styling and there were no css files so it is only EJS and html rendered. The app rendered an array of movies that came from the mongodb database and had various ways to sort them. Every movie had a unique id and you could see individual movie information. 

The app also used a Passport Strategy to implement authentication on the /rewards route. That route was meant to be for members only and would have special offers to people that were signed up.
